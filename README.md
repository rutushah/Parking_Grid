### Project Description :open_book:
ParkinGRid is a forward-thinking parking company that changes the way you park. We provide very seamless parking information. It's easy. You come in, park your vehicle and easily drive out. At ParkinGRid, we care about you, your car, and your time. Our parking technology means hassle-free parking. You can pay in with your computers, smartphone, and other devices. At ParkinGRid you can choose the area you wish to park your vehicle. From there, you can select our parking facility in that area. You can select your vehicle type 4-wheelers cars – sedans, hatchbacks, trucks, or your 2- wheeler bikes. ParkinGRid also allows you to select on which floor of the parking space you want to park your vehicle. For their convenience, there would also be reserved space for ‘Specially abled’ persons. After selecting the vehicle type and giving some information about yourself and your vehicle, a ticket/alphanumeric code would be generated. That can be only used once when you enter the parking premises as per the selected hours. A staff member would verify the tickets and assist you when you enter the parking premises for a safe and secure parking experience. Parking charges would be on an hourly basis or the plan is chosen. Your vehicle is safe and secure with us, there would be CCTV cameras everywhere on the premises to give a safe experience.
