<p class="aboutustext">
Founded in 2005, ParkingGrid pioneered the practice of managing traffic by analyzing data not just from road sensors, but also from vehicles. This breakthrough approach enabled ParkingGrid to become one of the leading providers of data and insight into how people move around the world.
<br>
<br>
ParkingGrid delivers innovative products for the automotive and transportation industries such as real-time parking and traffic information and solutions that facilitate the safe testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. We also provide new insights to a variety of other industries that can make better business decisions by understanding how people move throughout the day.
<br><br>
At ParkingGrid we see a world of possibilities enabled by making transportation more intelligent.
<br><br>
Parking grid is the leading provider of solutions for the last-mile of mobility. Our technology helps companies like Ticketmaster, Honda, and GasBuddy embed friction-free parking and other mobility-related services into their own products. The Arrive platform also powers our two award-winning consumer apps, ParkWhiz and BestParking. Over 40M people to date have used our web, app, voice, and API-based solutions to find and book convenient, economical parking.
<br><br>
When you book with ParkingGrid we guarantee you will have a spot to park at the price you paid or your money back. While ParkingGrid does not physically hold a specific spot open for each reservation, we work closely with our partners to monitor inventory levels and avoid overbooking.
